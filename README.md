* handling messy data 

	- missing data/NAs

	- staircase structures
	
	- data formats *csv, tsv, excel, tab)

	- consolidate individudual files to a master (merging)

* pipelines

	- about - what are workflows? 

	- building functions that are modular (build fxns, and call them seqentially) 

		- principe being the scope of the function 

		- easy of use, short code 

		- diagnose errors 

		- principle of modularity (Ex: code to create a figure) 



* initial onboarding 

	- variable types 
	
	- troubleshooting (changing variable type) 

	- common error readouts 

	- initialization of variables (overwriting and avoiding lengthy code)

	- how to comment effectively 

 

Best practices

* are you repeating code 

* general principles (functions and for loops) 

*  

start


saving to disc

editting files

nested for loops and is else statements 

moving outside of R as a statistical tool and to interacting with your data 

efficiency with data
